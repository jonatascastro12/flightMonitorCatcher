# Flight Monitor Catcher

This is an handmade scraper that visits Submarino's air prices page, according to setup in `destinos.json`, and sends the price to the manager API (https://github.com/jonatascastro12/flightMonitor/). It uses Node.js/PhantomJS.  

## Quick Start
- Install PhantomJS (http://phantomjs.org/)
- Run `phantom submarino.js`
